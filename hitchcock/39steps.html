<div class="stepsp">Canadian Richard Hanney is visiting London when he meets a mysterious spy named Annabella Smith. When Smith is murdered in his apartment, Hannay is forced to go on the run from both the police and the foreign spies who killed her. Heading north to Scotland, Hannay is seemingly betrayed at every opportunity. Can he prove his innocence and expose the foreign spies before it's too late? What are "The 39 Steps" ...and, most importantly, can he rid himself of the woman he finds himself handcuffed to?</div>
